== Introduction

An SWS application implemented in the Go Programming Language.

=== Docker Image

SWS is published as a docker image on https://hub.docker.com/r/jmazzitelli/sws[Docker hub at jmazzitelli/sws]

=== License and Copyright

See the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE file].

== Building

[NOTE]
These build instructions assume you have the following installed on your system: (1) link:http://golang.org/doc/install[Go Programming Language] which must be at least version 1.8, (2) link:http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git], (3) link:https://docs.docker.com/installation/[Docker], and (4) make. To run SWS on OpenShift after you build it, it is assumed you have a running OpenShift environment available to you. If you do not, you can find a set of link:#setting-up-openshift[instructions on how to set up OpenShift below]. To run SWS on Kubernetes after you built it, it is assumed you have a running Kubernetes environment available to you.

To build SWS:

* Clone this repository inside a GOPATH. These instructions will use the example GOPATH of "/source/go/swift-sunshine/swscore" but you can use whatever you want. Just change the first line of the below instructions to use your GOPATH.

[source,shell]
----
export GOPATH=/source/go/swift-sunshine/swscore
mkdir -p $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/swift-sunshine
cd src/github.com/swift-sunshine
git clone git@github.com:swift-sunshine/swscore
export PATH=${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin
----

* Install Glide - the Go dependency management tool that SWS uses to build itself

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make dep-install
----

* Tell the dependency manager tool to update the SWS dependencies
[NOTE]
You should only run this command if you add, remove, or modify a dependency. If you are simply git cloning and building from source, you should skip this step.

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make dep-update
----

* Build SWS

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make build
----

* At this point you can run the SWS tests

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make test
----

== Running

[NOTE]
Before running SWS, you must install and deploy link:https://istio.io[Istio] first. There are a few places that you can reference in order to learn how to do this such as link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial[here], link:https://blog.openshift.com/evaluate-istio-openshift/[here], and link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html[here]. There is also a link:hack/istio-install-openshift.sh[hack/istio-install-openshift.sh] script to help you install Istio if you are using OpenShift.

=== Running on OpenShift

==== Setting up OpenShift

The following section assumes that the user has link:https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift Origin] installed.

The link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenShift Origin Documentation] will outline all the steps required.

You can alternatively build OpenShift Origin from source and run that. See link:hack/README.adoc[] for a quick way to do this using the *-openshift.sh scripts provided by this project.

==== Building the Docker Image

Create the SWS docker image through the "docker" make target:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make docker
----

==== Deploying SWS to OpenShift

[NOTE]
The following commands assume that the `oc` command is available in the user's path and that the user is logged in.

The deploy and undeploy commands are automated in the Makefile. The following will undeploy an old installation of SWS, if available, and deploy a new one:
----
make openshift-deploy
----

==== Undeploying SWS from OpenShift

If you want to remove SWS from your OpenShift environment, you can do so by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make openshift-undeploy
----

=== Running on Kubernetes

[WARNING]
These instructions may not be fully working. Try OpenShift if these SWS instructions do not work on Kubernetes.

==== Setting up Kubernetes

The following section assumes that the user has link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes[Kubernetes] installed.

==== Building the Docker Image

Create the SWS docker image through the "docker" make target:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make docker
----

==== Deploying SWS to Kubernetes

[NOTE]
The following commands assume that the `kubectl` command is available in the user's path and that the user is logged in.

[NOTE]
In order to deploy on Kubernetes and to be able to access the deployed service, you must ensure you have Ingress support. If you are using minikube, you need to run `minikube addons enable ingress` and add `sws` as a hostname in your `/etc/hosts` via something like this command: `echo "$(minikube ip) sws" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

The deploy and undeploy commands are automated in the Makefile. The following will undeploy an old installation of SWS, if available, and deploy a new one:
----
make k8s-deploy
----

==== Undeploying SWS from Kubernetes

If you want to remove SWS from your Kubernetes environment, you can do so by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make k8s-undeploy
----

=== Running Standalone

Sometimes you may want to run SWS outside of any container environment, perhaps for debugging purposes. To do this, run:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make install
make run
----

The "install" target installs the SWS executable in your GOPATH /bin directory so you can run it outside of the Makefile:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/swift-sunshine/swscore
make install
${GOPATH}/bin/sws -config <your-config-file>
----

== Environment Variables

Many configuration settings can optionally be set via environment variables. If one of the environment variables below are set, they serve as the default value for its associated YAML configuration setting. The following are currently supported:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Environment Variable Name|Description and YAML Setting

|`IDENTITY_CERT_FILE`
|Certificate file used to identify the file server. If set, you must go over https to retrieve content from the file server.
[source,yaml]
----
identity:
  cert_file: VALUE
----

|`IDENTITY_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`
|Private key file used to identify the server. If set, you must go over https to retrieve content from the file server.
[source,yaml]
----
identity:
  private_key_file: VALUE
----

|`SERVER_ADDRESS`
|Where the http server is bound to.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  address: VALUE
----

|`SERVER_PORT`
|Where the http server is listening.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: VALUE
----

|`SERVER_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME`
|If this (and password) is set, these credentials are required in order to get content from the server.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  credentials:
    username: VALUE
----

|`SERVER_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD`
|If this (and username) is set, these credentials are required in order to get content from the server.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  credentials:
    password: VALUE
----

|`SERVER_STATIC_CONTENT_ROOT_DIRECTORY`
|The file server will serve all static content found under this root directory.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  static_content_root_directory: VALUE
----
