= Releasing Kiali

This document covers the specifics of releasing Kiali, and is meant as a guide
for Kiali release managers.

The summary of the process is the following:

* Create a new JIRA issue for the release
* Make sure Getting Started docs are complete
* Update Kiali UI version
* Publish the API Docs
* Update Makefile
* Create the Release PR
* Tag Git Repo
* Notify Istio and Openshift Istio Teams for changes:
** Istio Helm Charts
** Istio Ansible Installer
** Openshift Istio Ansible Installer (istiooc)
* Update JIRA issues included with the release
* Send out notifications (twitter, mailing lists, IRC)

== Creating a new JIRA issue

Create a new issue on link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI[JIRA] detailing the
release, and add sub-tasks if necessary.

== Updating Docs

First step is to make sure the "Getting Started" document for the website is up
to date and works with the new version.

The docs can be found link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali.io[here]. Do the
changes, and create a PR.

== Updating Kiali UI

The specifics of releasing Kiali UI can be found
link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui/blob/master/RELEASING.adoc[here].

Releasing Kiali UI should come before releasing the core, as the image is
created as soon as the tag for core is pushed to master.

== Publish API docs

API docs are generated by swagger, and this comment will both install it and
generate the updated documentation.

[source, bash]
----
$ make swagger-install swagger-gen
----

== Update Makefile

Change the VERSION variable on Makefile to the new version, this is what is
going to be shown on the UI, and also what Travis will use to trigger the
release process.

[source, diff]
----
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index c1f7f80..aa0c54a 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile

-VERSION ?= v0.5.1-SNAPSHOT
+VERSION ?= v1.0.0
 COMMIT_HASH ?= $(shell git rev-parse HEAD)

 # Indicates which version of the UI console is to be embedded
----

By default, the Makefile gets the latest version of the UI, so we'll also
change the console version on the Makefile:

-CONSOLE_VERSION ?= latest

----

One thing to keep in mind is that CONSOLE_VERSION comes from the npm
repository, and may not be the same as VERSION. You can get the console version
link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kiali/kiali-ui?activeTab=versions[here].

== Creating the release PR

[source, bash]
----
$ git add Makefile swagger.json
$ git commit -m "v1.0.0 Release"
$ git push <your remote> master
----

Create a GitHub PR, have someone review it, and then merge it.

After the merge, Travis will run the test suite, build the binary, and push the
"latest" docker image to link:https://hub.docker.com/r/kiali/kiali[DockerHub].

== Tag Git Repo

Now you need to pull the latest master with the merged commit, and create the
tag for it.

[source, bash]
----
$ git pull
$ git tag v1.0.0 <merge commit id hash>
$ git push origin v1.0.0
----

Once the tag has been pushed, Travis will immediately run another build, but
this time will tag the docker image with the same version string as the git tag
name. In the example above, the docker image pushed to DockerHub will not be
tagged with "latest" but will instead be tagged with "v1.0.0".

You can let the committers know that the release has been completed and PRs can
begin to be merged again. Though, it would be best to wait for this
notification to go out until after you bump up the version string to the next
snapshot version (see "Prepare For The Next Release" below).

Note that, in the example above, the docker image pushed to DockerHub will not
be tagged with "latest" but will instead be tagged with "1.0.0.Final."

== Notify Istio and Openshift Istio Teams for changes

There are no fixed steps for releasing a new version on the istio installer,
each release is kind of different.

This has been done a few times before, so they can be used as references:

* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/5869
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/5921
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6192
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6592
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6594
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/7042
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/7007

Those PRs cover both the ansible-installer and the helm installer updates.

== Updating JIRA issues

Here, we move all issues tagged as `Ready to Release` to `Released`, with
`Fix-Version` set to the actual release version.

After that, close the release issues, and then, create a new `Release` in JIRA
for the next release.

== Send out notifications

Finally, we just need to send the nofications to create awareness of the new
release.

Post an email about the release on our
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/kiali-dev[Mailing List].

Send a message on our channel at Freenode, #kiali.

Post a message on our twitter,
link:https://www.twitter.com/KialiProject[@KialiProject]. If you don't know
who's responsible for the account, ask on IRC.

== Preparing for the Next Release

After the release happens, you'll need to prepare Kiali for the next one. This means changing the Makefile to the defaults:

[source, diff]
----
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index c1f7f80..4a8af40 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile

----


== Finished Product

Once the above steps have been performed, the release is complete. There is now a DockerHub image for that release in the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/kiali/kiali/tags/[Kiali Docker Hub repo].

== How It Works

Most of the magic is set up in the link:.travis.yml[] file.

If the Travis build is a tag build, then the tag name is passed to all Makefiles as the value of the DOCKER_VERSION environment variable. The Makefiles use that to tag the docker images when building and pushing the images to DockerHub.

If the Travis build is a branch build (that is, not triggered by a tag), the name of the branch is set to the DOCKER_VERSION variable with the exception of the `master` branch. If the branch name is `master`, the DOCKER_VERSION is set to "latest".  Again, the value of the DOCKER_VERSION variable is then used by the Makefile to tag the docker images.

Note that only tags or branches in the format `v\#.#.#[.Label]` will trigger release tag/branch builds.

== Creating a Hotfix

Sometimes there's the need of adding a hotfix to an already released version.
That's what the `patch` number on the version is.

The first step is to create a new branch for the version:

[source, bash]
----
$ git checkout -b v1.0.1 v1.0.0
$ git push origin v1.0.1
----

Then we cherry-pick the commits that we need, or create PRs targeting this
branch. Note that commits pushed to this branch might need to be mirrored on
master, else those commits will be lost.

After the fixes have been added, create the tag (as seen on the last step), and
that's it.
